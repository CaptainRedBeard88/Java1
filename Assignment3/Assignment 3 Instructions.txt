Assignment 3

Develop a Java application that determines whether any of several
department-store customers has exceeded the credit limit on a
charge account.  For each customer the following must be available:

a) account number
b) total of all items charged by the customer this month
c) total of all items charged by the customer this month
d) total of all credits applied to the customer's account this month
e) allowed credit limit

The program should input all of these as integers, calculate the new
balance (=beginning balance + charges - credits), display the new
balance and determine whether the new balance exceeds the customer's
credit limit.  For those customers whose credit limit is exceeded, the
program should display the message "Credit limit exceeded".
