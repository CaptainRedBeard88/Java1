Assignment 4

Write an application that displays the following patterns seperately,
one below the other.  Use for loops to generate the patterns. All
asterisks (*) should be printed by a single statement of the form
	System.out.print("*");
which causes the asterisks to print side by side.  A statement of
the form
	System.out.println();
can be used to move to the next line.  A statement of the form
	System.out.print(" ");
can be used to display a space for the last 2 patterns.  There should
be no other output statements in the program.
