Use a one-dimensional array to solve the following problem:
Write an application that inputs 5 numbers, each of which is
between 10 and 100, inclusive.  As each number is read,
display it only if it is not a duplicate of a nubmer already
read.  Provide for the "worst case," in which all 5 numbers
are different.  Use the smallest possible array to solve
this problem.  Display the complete set of unique values input
after the user inputs each new value.
